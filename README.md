Here are the commands I found **useful** while learning Git.  

### Git commands

git clone:  
> ***$*** git clone [url]
> - This command is used to obtain a repository from an existing URL.  
  
git add:  
> ***$*** git add [file]
> - This command adds one or more file to the staging area.  
  
git commit:
> ***$*** git commit -m "explain your commit"
> - This command records or snapshots the file permanently in the version history.
